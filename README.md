This project is a webpage that revolves around goal 6 of the UNs 17 sustainable development goals. It is a scrollytelling website that lets the viewer get a deeper insight into the problem through animations and animated figures as you scroll through the page. It will also showcase some facts around this problem.

This project is useful in the sense that it showcase a big problem for everyone on the planet. Maybe it can make people realize that clean water is not available for everyone in the world, and the project makes people want to contribute to solving this problem. It is also very relevent to showcase this problem using technology that is available for a lot of people, a webpage.

The way users can get started with this project is to open the webpage and then start scrolling. As the user is scrolling a story will unfold. The story will progress through the scrolling. So basically the only thing the user needs to do is to scroll and let the story unfold.

We have used figma for both the low and high fidelity sketches. In the beginning we created a word file where we wrote down how we wanted to implement our idea. We use Visual Studio Code to pull the files to GitHub. In the main project we are using: HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript. 

This project is created by 3 students from NTNU. All 3 of us working closely together and contributing to the project.
